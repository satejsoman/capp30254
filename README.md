## how to run and view assignments
Each homework assignment has a `code/` folder and a `latex/` folder. All relevant code to perform analysis or experiments is in the `code/` folder. The PDF file in the `latex/` folder is the report for that assignment. Additional assignment-specific instructions are in each assignment's folder.
